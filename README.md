# OODWorkshop
It's a repository with practical tasks for workshop related to OOD.

Of course, we will focus on Object Oriented Design, but first step will be related to solution of our project. Actually, we have a bunch of tasks:

1. Create class "Car" with some fields. Branch "version-0.1"
Okay... let's agree that now program is a bit spagetti-code because of complexity Car class and using this class. How to add possibility move printed car? It's too hard. Let's see how to segregate responsibilies and etc. to make it better!
2. Change our codebase to follow Object Oriented Design.
  1) Let's delete method Print. Car should not print to console, let's delegate it to another object.
  2) Let's move 
  3) Let's wrap public fields by getters and setters, also create setting data in constructor.
