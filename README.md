# OODWorkshop
It's a repository with practical tasks for workshop related to OOD.

Of course, we will focus on Object Oriented Design, but first step will be related to solution of our project. Actually, we have a bunch of tasks:

1. Create solution in Visual Studio(Enterprise, Proffesional or Community, doesn't matter).
2. Create class "Car" with some fields.
3. Change our codebase to follow Object Oriented Design.
